# Project Overview

This is a personal portfolio website for Altaf Malek, an IT professional with skills in IT administration and Android development. The website is built with plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and it uses the Bootstrap framework for responsive design.

The website consists of the following pages:
*   **index.html**: The main landing page with a brief introduction and skills overview.
*   **resume.html**: A page to display Altaf's resume.
*   **portfolio.html**: A gallery of projects.
*   **contact.html**: A contact form.

# Building and Running

This is a static website, so there is no build process. To run the website, simply open the `index.html` file in a web browser.

# Development Conventions

The project uses standard HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The code is not minified or bundled.

*   **Styling**: The project uses Bootstrap for basic styling, with a custom `style.css` file for additional styles.
*   **JavaScript**: The project uses jQuery for a simple fade-in animation on page load.
*   **Dependencies**: The project relies on Bootstrap and jQuery, which are included via CDNs.
